<!-- Another useful validation feature is the pattern attribute, which expects a Regular Expression as its value. A regular expression (regexp) is a pattern that can be used to match character combinations in text strings,
so regexps are ideal for form validation and serve a variety of other uses in JavaScript.

Regexps are quite complex, and we don't intend to teach you them exhaustively in this article. Below are some examples to give you a basic idea of how they work.

a — Matches one character that is a (not b, not aa, and so on).
abc — Matches a, followed by b, followed by c.
ab?c — Matches a, optionally followed by a single b, followed by c. (ac or abc)
ab*c — Matches a, optionally followed by any number of bs, followed by c. (ac, abc, abbbbbc, and so on).
a|b — Matches one character that is a or b.
abc|xyz — Matches exactly abc or exactly xyz (but not abcxyz or a or y, and so on).
There are many more possibilities that we don't cover here. For a complete list and many examples, consult our Regular expression documentation.

Let's implement an example. Update your HTML to add a pattern attribute like this: -->

<form>
    <label for="choose">Would you prefer a banana or a cherry?</label>
    <input id="choose" name="i-like" required pattern="[Bb]anana|[Cc]herry" />
    <button>Submit</button>
  </form>
